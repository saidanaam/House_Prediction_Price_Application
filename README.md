This project is inspired by Code Basics and walks you through a step-by-step process for building a real estate price prediction website. The project is divided into three main stages:

**1. Model Development:** Using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle, we'll build a predictive model using Python's sklearn library, applying linear regression. This phase includes data loading, cleaning, and preparing the dataset, followed by training a model to predict home prices based on factors like square footage and the number of bedrooms.

**2. Flask API:** After training the model, we'll create a Python Flask server to handle HTTP requests. This server will take user input (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms) and return the predicted price using the saved model.

**3. Web Interface:** The final step is developing a user-friendly web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users will be able to input property details and get instant price predictions by making requests to the Flask server.

**In this project, we'll cover core data science concepts, including:**

* Data loading and cleaning with Numpy and Pandas
* Outlier detection and removal
* Feature engineering
* Dimensionality reduction
* Model tuning using GridSearchCV
* K-Fold cross-validation

**Technologies and tools used in this project include:**

1. Python for building the model and API
2. Numpy and Pandas for data preprocessing
3. Matplotlib for visualizations
4. Scikit-learn (sklearn) for model development
5. Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, and PyCharm as IDEs
6. Flask for building the API
7. HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the user interface.
This project offers a comprehensive hands-on approach, helping you develop a full-stack data science application.
